I can't name one person I know that doesn't procrastinate. It's a part of the human being. We **procrastinate**. And this isn't as bad as we want you to believe. In this article, I'll share with you one concept that helped me cope with procrastination.

_But what exactly is procrastination?_

_Procrastination_ is the act of **delaying** or **postponing** a task or a set of tasks. It's the tendency to do less urgent tasks in preference to more urgent ones. No need to elaborate more on that, let's keep things simple.

## What Is Structured Procrastination

[Structured Procrastination](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com) is a concept invented by John Perry [^1], a professor of philosophy at Stanford. It's the act of using the procrastination strength to do things on your list that aren't the most important one. That way, you're still procrastinating, but you're doing tasks on your list.

I love this paragraph on his website that explains it a bit differently:

> Structured procrastination means shaping the structure of the tasks one has to do in a way that exploits this fact [he explains that procrastination is just finding a way of not doing something more important]. The list of tasks one has in mind will be ordered by importance. Tasks that seem most urgent and important are on top. But there are also worthwhile tasks to perform lower down on the list. Doing these tasks becomes a way of not doing the things higher up on the list. With this sort of appropriate task structure, the procrastinator becomes a useful citizen. Indeed, the procrastinator can even acquire, as I have, a reputation for getting a lot done.

## How to Use Structured Procrastination

When you procrastinate, you're not doing the one thing you should do. When you find yourself in this pattern, first acknowledge it. Don't blame yourself. **Just acknowledge and don't find excuses**. Accepting what you feel is a big step in the right direction.

Then, pick one less important task. That way, your brain still get this impression of procrastinating by not doing the most important task. But you'll still be doing things, and that's the key of Structured Procrastination.

John Perry also answers this question that you may have asked yourself:

> "How about the important tasks at the top of the list, that one never does?"

> The trick is to pick the right sorts of projects for the top of the list. The ideal sorts of things have two characteristics. First, they seem to have clear deadlines (but really don't). Second, they seem awfully important (but really aren't).

## What if I don't even want to start doing other things?

The following method works great on me. I know it depends on individuals, but I'll share it with you, hoping it can help you.
If structured procrastination (doing things that aren't as important but still on your list of things to do) doesn't work and you find yourself browsing Twitter / Reddit / Hacker News / (insert your favorite and guilty thing you do when you procrastinate), tell you that you will only do one thing at the bottom of your list for **two minutes**.

With the "OK, just two minutes of this", you'll eventually find yourself doing the task for longer than the initial two minutes, and sometimes even enjoying finally doing the thing at the bottom of your list.

## A personal example

For my company, I needed to do a simple administrative procedure (related to VAT). It took me 5 minutes to do. But in reality, it took me days. I didn't procrastinate about it because I didn't have time. That's what I would have said if I had been lying to myself. The real reason was because **fear** was what I was truly feeling. I was afraid of making a mistake, afraid of having irregularities with my company, and a lot more irrational fears. But one day, when I didn't want to do an even more important task (_hello structured procrastination_), I said to myself: "OK, maybe just go to the government site, and check if it's gonna take a long time". And 5 minutes later, the task was **done**. Thanks to **Structured Procrastination**.

If you want to read more about procrastination, I can't recommend enough this article written by Tim Urban of Wait But Why [^2] called [Why Procrastinators Procrastinate](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html).

I saw [a lot](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/smarter-living/tips-to-stop-procrastinating.html) [of articles](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200121-why-procrastination-is-about-managing-emotions-not-time) in the past year talking about how procrastination isn't a time-management problem, but is an **Emotional Problem**. You're not particularly avoiding work or the thing itself, but most likely avoiding negative emotions. By knowing this, it can help you to acknowledge why you're procrastinating. You can visualize the negative emotions you're trying to avoid. It was a big step for me.

TLDR: When you find yourself procrastinating over an important thing, use your procrastination power to do things that are less important.
