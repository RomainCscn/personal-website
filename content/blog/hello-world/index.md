This is my very first post on this blog, and more generally on any blog I've ever had. I've always wanted to have a blog. Being able to share contents, knowledges, fun facts or even personal stories.

I think it's time **now**. I procrastinated a lot to be honest and was thinking about writing articles for a long time.

You may wonder, _what made it clicks this time? Why now?_
I was inspired and convinced by the `#100DaysToOffload` [^1] concept (created by [Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk/)).

I can't explain it better than the site itself so this is a quote to quickly sum it up:

> The rationale behind the whole thing is to challenge people to publish 100 posts on their personal blog in a year. That's approximately 1 post every 3.5 days.
> The point of #100DaysToOffload is to be a relaxing and cathartic experience. Not a worrisome affair where youâ€™re thinking of things to write all the time.

There is precise guidelines included on the [website](https://100daystooffload.com) but what convinced me the most was those simple two words:

> **Just. Write.**

It completely blows all the excuses I always made to myself that allowed me to avoid writing. I'm not waiting anymore and I'm starting _today_. See you on the 1st June 2021, with **100** articles on this blog!
