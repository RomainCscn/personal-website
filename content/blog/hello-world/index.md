This is my very first post on this blog, and more generally on any blog I've ever had. I've always wanted to have one. Being able to share contents, knowledge, fun facts or even personal stories.

I think it's time **now**. I procrastinated a lot to be honest and was considering writing articles for while.

You may wonder, _what made it click this time? Why now?_
I was inspired and convinced by the `#100DaysToOffload` [^1] concept (created by [Kev Quirk](https://kevq.uk/)).

I can't explain it better than the site itself so this is a quote to quickly sum it up:

> "The rationale behind the whole thing is to challenge people to publish 100 posts on their personal blog in a year. That's approximately 1 post every 3.5 days.
> The point of #100DaysToOffload is to be a relaxing and cathartic experience. Not a worrisome affair where you’re thinking of things to write all the time."

There are precise guidelines included on the [website](https://100daystooffload.com) but what convinced me the most were those two simple words:

> “**Just. Write.**”

It completely blows all the excuses I always made to myself that allowed me to avoid writing. I'm not waiting anymore and I'm starting _today_. See you on the June 3, 2020, with **100** articles on this blog!
